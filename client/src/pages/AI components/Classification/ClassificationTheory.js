          Classification is a supervised machine learning technique used to categorize data into predefined classes or labels. It involves training a model on a labeled dataset, where the input features are associated with known class labels. The trained model can then predict the class of new, unseen data based on learned patterns. Common algorithms include decision trees, logistic regression, support vector machines, and neural networks. Classification is widely used in applications such as spam detection, image recognition, medical diagnosis, and sentiment analysis. By accurately assigning class labels, classification aids in decision-making and automating tasks that require distinguishing between different categories.

                            Classification is used when the target variable is categorical and the goal is to categorize instances into distinct classes. Examples include spam detection, medical diagnosis, image classification, and sentiment analysis.
