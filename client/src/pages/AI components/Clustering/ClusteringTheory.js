          <strong>Clustering</strong> is a type of unsupervised learning in machine learning and statistics that involves grouping a set of objects in such a way that objects in the same group (called a cluster) are more similar to each other than to those in other groups. It aims to discover inherent structures in data without prior knowledge of group labels. Algorithms such as K-means, hierarchical clustering, and DBSCAN assign data points to clusters so that points within the same cluster are more similar to each other than those in other clusters. Clustering is used in various domains such as customer segmentation, image segmentation, anomaly detection, and pattern recognition. It helps in understanding data distribution, identifying outliers, and organizing data into meaningful groups for further analysis and decision-making.
