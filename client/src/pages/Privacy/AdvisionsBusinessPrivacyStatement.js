      <section>
        <h4>Customer Responsibilities</h4>
        <p>As data controllers, Customers decide which of their employees or other authorized personnel are given access to the AB services. They do this by designating one or more AB account administrators or group administrators (“Administrator”) who act on behalf of the Customer and have the ability to customize the Customer account, manage individual User accounts, access the AB Insights tool and related reporting features, access the AB Administrator tools, and populate the Customer account with Customer-provided content. Customers are solely responsible for establishing policies for and ensuring compliance with all applicable laws and regulations, relating to the collection of personal information relating to individual Users selected by Customers for accessing the AB services. Advisions has no direct relationship with individual Users, who should contact Customers (their employer) for assistance with any requests or questions relating to the processing of their personal information.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h4>Scope of the Privacy Statement</h4>
        <p>For avoidance of doubt, this Privacy Statement does not apply to:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Any processing of data for the purpose of marketing the AB service to enterprise and corporate prospects.</li>
          <li>Any other offerings available at Advisions.com separate from the AB services, for which the Advisions Privacy Policy is applicable. A User may already have an account with Advisions to access Advisions’s consumer marketplace educational content (“Marketplace”), and data processed as a result of the use of the Advisions Marketplace from a User account is governed by the Advisions Privacy Policy.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h4>Changes to the Privacy Statement</h4>
        <p>In the event where Advisions makes any material changes to the manner in which it processes User data to provide its services to Customers, it will notify Customers.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h4>Information About Users Collected and Stored by Advisions</h4>
        <p>When a User is given access to the AB services by the Administrator, a User may set up an individual User account and Advisions will collect information provided by the User or the Administrator. The Customer can customize the type of data requested to create an account, which may include the following:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Required:</strong> First name, last name, and email address.</li>
          <li><strong>Optional:</strong> Photo, areas of interest, job skills, goals, and role.</li>
          <li><strong>Other personal data</strong> as allowed by the Customer.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>A unique identifying number is assigned by Advisions upon the creation of a User account. User profile pages may be viewable by other Users in the same AB organization but are not viewable by individuals outside of the organization. Administrators may assign a User to a group membership.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h4>Single Sign-On (SSO)</h4>
        <p>Customers may choose to integrate AB with a Single Sign On (SSO) identity provider to enable Users to log in to AB User accounts without the need to disclose hashed passwords to Advisions. Users may log in by providing their individual SSO credentials to the SSO identity provider, which will authenticate them and allow or deny access to the Customer account. SSO identity providers share with Advisions a unique cookie ID and authentication “token” information to recognize the User as an authorized user of Customer.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h4>User Interactions and Shared Content</h4>
        <p>Customers may choose whether Administrators and Users can interact with others (including with instructors, teaching assistants, and other students) by posting reviews about educational content, messaging or chatting, posting questions or answers, or posting other content. Posted content is stored by Advisions and may be publicly available or viewable by others, including Administrators, Users, or instructors and teaching assistants, depending on where the content is posted.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h4>Optional Integrations</h4>
        <p>At the option of the Customer, Administrators may enable the ability to “Share to Slack.” This feature allows Users to manually or automatically post a message to the Customer’s own instance of the Slack messaging service. To enable this optional functionality, Customer's Slack administrators must grant Advisions the ability to read the full list of public channels, private channels, and users in the Customer’s Slack instance. These lists may include individuals in Customer’s Slack instance who are not AB Users. Slack user lists and channels are briefly cached before being automatically purged from Advisions's systems.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h4>Activity Information</h4>
        <p>Advisions stores information relating to the activities of Users as they use and interact with the AB services, such as content viewed, searched for, or accessed (and information relating to that content); interactions with instructors, teaching assistants, Administrators, and other Users; as well as answers, essays, and other items submitted by Users to satisfy the educational content requirements. This information is linked to a User’s unique account ID and is shared with Customers via the Customer Account reporting tools or upon request of the Customer.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h4>User Support</h4>
        <p>The AB service enables Users to contact the Advisions Support Team for assistance or to report a problem, concern, potential abuse, or other issues regarding the AB services or other users. Advisions may collect and store the User’s name, email address, location, operating system, IP address as well as the User’s activity on the Advisions platform and communications with the Advisions help desk team. Advisions may request additional information from Users in order to resolve any issue reported by a User or by another user.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h4>Automated Data Collection</h4>
        <p>When a User uses the AB services, Advisions collects and stores certain information by automated means:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Technical Information:</strong> IP address, operating system type and version, unique device ID, browser, browser language, domain, and other operating systems or platform information. This information is collected through the use of server log files and tracking technologies, such as:
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Cookies:</strong> Small files that websites send to a computer or wireless device to uniquely identify a browser or mobile device or to store information in a browser setting.</li>
              <li><strong>Other Tracking Technologies:</strong> See below for more detailed information.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>IP addresses received from browsers or devices of Users may be used to determine the approximate location of Users.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h4>Payment Information</h4>
        <p>If a Customer makes purchases via credit card, Advisions collects certain data about the purchase (such as name and ZIP code) as necessary to process the order. Customers must provide certain payment and billing data directly to Advisions’s payment processing partners, including name, credit card information, billing address, and ZIP code. Advisions may also receive limited information, like the fact that Customers have a new card and the last four digits of that card, from payment service providers to facilitate payments. For security, Advisions does not collect or store sensitive cardholder data, such as full credit card numbers or card authentication data. If you are not satisfied with provided services then make refund ticket and will review your account and 100% refund within 2 days.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h4>Purpose of User Data Processing and Retention Period</h4>
        <p>Advisions processes the information collected about Users and Administrators for the purpose of providing the AB services to its Customers, specifically:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Providing, administering, and facilitating access to the AB services, for Customers and Users, and managing Customer or User account preferences</li>
          <li>Fulfilling Customer’s instructions with respect to personal data of Users</li>
          <li>Communicating with Users, including via email, for the purpose of:
            <ul>
              <li>Responding to User questions or concerns</li>
              <li>Making notifications to Users at the request of the Customer</li>
              <li>Sending Users administrative messages and information, including messages from instructors and teaching assistants, notifications about changes to the AB service, and updates to our agreements</li>
              <li>Providing information to Users about their use of the AB service, such as upcoming course information and recommended courses</li>
              <li>Sending Users information relating to the AB service, such as newsletters, new service offerings, surveys, and other matters that may be of interest to the User. Users may opt out of receiving such emails by following the opt-out instructions provided in the email.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Advisions stores User data as long as instructed by its Customers, subject to applicable law. Advisions will delete certain or all personal data relating to Users upon request of the Customer.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h4>Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies</h4>
        <p>Like many online platforms, Advisions uses server log files and automated data collection tools, such as browser cookies and scripts. Cookies are small text files placed onto a computer or device while browsing the Internet. Cookies are used to collect, store, and share bits of information about User activities. Advisions uses both session cookies and persistent cookies to deliver and secure the AB service; provide functionality, like customizing a user’s view or remembering a user’s preferences; and measure site, service, or feature usage. Advisions may tie the information collected by these means to the unique account ID of Users.</p>
        <p>To view a complete list of cookies and your options, Users may click the “Cookie settings” link on the footer of the AB site.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h4>User Preferences with Respect to Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies</h4>
        <p>Users can adjust their cookie settings by clicking the “Cookie settings” link on the footer of the AB site, or they may set their web browser to notify them about the placement of new cookies, limit the type of cookies or reject cookies altogether. If a browser is set to block cookies, Users may not be able to use some or all of the features of the AB services (for example, may not be able to log in). General information about cookies and how to disable them can be found at <a href="https://cookiepedia.co.uk/all-about-cookies">Cookiepedia</a>.</p>
        <p>Various browsers may offer their own management tools for removing HTML5 LSOs.</p>
        <p>Most modern web browsers give you the option to send a Do Not Track signal to the websites you visit, indicating that you do not wish to be tracked. However, there is no accepted standard for how a website should respond to this signal, and we do not take any action in response to this signal. Instead, in addition to publicly available third-party tools, we offer you the choices described in this policy to manage the collection and use of information about you.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h4>Sharing User Information</h4>
        <p>In order to provide the AB services to its Customers, Advisions shares data regarding Users with a number of third-party service providers. These third parties are contractually required to use User data solely as directed by Advisions for the purpose of providing services to Advisions. Administrators of existing Customers are able to access our list of current sub-processors on the left sidebar of this page while logged in to AB.</p>
        <p>Instructors who upload content on the Advisions platform, as well as their teaching assistants, may receive names of enrolled Users, to enable them to respond to user questions and feedback. Instructors do not receive the email addresses of Users. Other service providers of Customer may receive information as instructed by Customer.</p>
        <p>To perform its services, Advisions leases servers from data centers and uses cloud hosting services on which certain content and User data relating to AB is hosted.</p>
        <p>Advisions’s help center platform vendor hosts and stores all communications between Administrators or Users and the Advisions support team. The help center vendor is contractually required to store and process User related data solely as directed by Advisions for the purpose of providing services to Advisions. Advisions also partners with a chat messaging vendor to provide support to Users and Administrators, to collect feedback, and to display in-app messages for feature announcements or onboarding new users.</p>
        <p>Advisions shares User information with third-party companies that perform email services to enable Advisions to send email communications to Users and to manage email preference settings of Users.</p>
        <p>For Leadership Academy users, certain features like chat rooms, message boards, news groups, or other public forums are available and are visible to other participants, so confidential or proprietary information should only be shared in accordance with their organization’s standards.</p>
        <p>Any other sharing of User data is subject to the consent and instructions of the Customer.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h4>Processing of User Data Outside of the EEA</h4>
        <p>Our servers and subprocessors are located in the United States. In order to provide the Services to you, we transfer and process your data there. If personal data processed by Advisions originates from a User or Administrator in the EEA, Advisions will ensure that such processing will only take place if:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>The non-EEA country in question ensures an adequate level of data protection</li>
          <li>The transfer is made pursuant to a Data Processing Agreement (“DPA”) executed between Advisions and the Customer and subject to the standard contractual clauses, designed to facilitate transfers of personal data from the EEA to all third countries, that have been adopted by the European Commission (known as the “Model Clauses”), which have been incorporated into the DPA.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>General</h4>
        <p><strong>Translation for Convenience Purposes Only:</strong> In the event that Customer has been provided a translated version of the Advisions Business Privacy Statement in a language other than English, that translation is provided for convenience purposes only. The English version of the AB Privacy Statement provided at <a href="https://www.advisions.com/terms/ab-privacy/">Advisions Privacy Policy</a> is controlling, and in the event of a conflict between the English version of this Privacy Statement and any translated version, the English version will prevail.</p>
